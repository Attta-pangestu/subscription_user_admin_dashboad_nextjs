This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Subscription User Admin Dashboard with Next.js

This open-source project aims to simplify user management and subscription tracking. Built using Next.js, it provides an intuitive admin dashboard for managing user accounts, subscription plans, and analytics. Whether youâ€™re a developer, product manager, or business owner, our dashboard streamlines user-related tasks, allowing you to focus on what matters most.

Key Features:

User Management: Add, edit, and deactivate user accounts effortlessly.
Subscription Tracking: Monitor subscription plans, renewal dates, and payment history.
Analytics Dashboard: Visualize user engagement, conversion rates, and churn metrics.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across devices, ensuring a smooth user experience.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
